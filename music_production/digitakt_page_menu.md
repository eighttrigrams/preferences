# Digitakt II - Page menu

In **recording mode**, in a *multi-bar* pattern,
we can select
1) which bar is represented by the Trigs
2) which bar plays

When the Page button is pressed in recording mode,
trigs 9-16 allow us to select only a subset of
bars to play of the full pattern. The ones that
are played are green-lit. When none are green-lit,
or when all are green-lit, the full pattern plays.

- Click Page and upper row trigs to select the trigs apply to, i.e. which bar is shown (no-follow)
- Click Page and lower row trigs to select which ones to play at all
- Clear a single track page only
    - In recording mode
    - Select a Track
    - Press [PAGE] to select the page
    - then press [PAGE] + [PLAY] to clear just that page **of the track**
